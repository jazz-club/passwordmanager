# Encrypted File Storage

# Tech Stack
## FrontEnd 

### Web UI
**HTML/CSS/[Electron]**: The frontend will primarily be written as a plain website that can be easily ported into an electron app for functionality.
**React**: I'm going to use react js for the frontend development less out of a need for fancy functionality and moreso to maintain an easy to work with component based architecture.


## Backend

**libsodium.js**: libsodium has a relatively easy to implement and high level abstraction of crytographic primitives, in addition to the native utilities for RNG. XChaCha20-Poly130 is secure encryption for the requirements of this project and likely the best choice. 
**FastAPI**: I decided on using FastAPI for a python backend as a learning excercise since I primarily work with javascript and would like the chance to create a more fleshed out project in Python. Additionally, I already know FastAPI makes implementing `REST` endpoints incredibly easy which will likely be the bulk of this project in terms of transport. 
**PostgressSQL**: PostgressSQL is the easiest to implement storage method for most of the metadata, permissions, and other file related info. 
**MinIO**: MinIO will be the basis for storing encrypted objects, chosen mostly because of the S3 compataibility. 
**HashiCorp**: HashiCorp vault is a relatively well known and tested tool for secret management that I will use for key management.
**nginx**: There is no need for very specialised functionality beside reverse proxying and TLS, so nginx suffices as the most rational option for this project.
**Docker**: All services will be configured as Docker containers, both for enviroment reasons, and also as an excuse to familiarise myself more with Docker as a proffesional tool. 

# Architecture 

Apologies for being a terrible graphic designer:

The full application will be deployed as a DockerCompose stack, the backend and frontend will both be compartamentalised seperately. 
The project will ofcourse use standard TLS encryption in addition to other technical solutions to security, `nginx` will need to exposre a public port for routing. Most requests other than backend traffic will be locally routed. The backend can interface `PostgressSQL` for metadata and system information and `MinIO` seperately for encrypted object storage. 

I decided on implementing encryption entirely client-side, both because this is the practice I am most familiar with and also for the sake of reducing the amount of trust placed in any non local providers (in our case still our Docker containers, but as a best practice measure). 

# Crypto 

With the aforementioned decision of cryptographic operations being entirely client sided, plainttext will never need to be routed over the network, despite taking steps to still ensure security during the transport process. Some important definitions for this: 

- `REK` - "Root Encryption Key". 
The primary encryption Key.

- `DK` - "Derived Key". 
Argon2id derived key to use with the `REK`

- `MK` - "Metadata Key". 
The secondary (and seperate) key used for metadata and related information.

- `FK` - "File Key". 
The "password" used for individual encrypted objects.

- `nonce` 
Random noise as an encryption primitive. 


# Walkthrough 

Upon account creation the client will create a password hash using standard cryptographic procedures and then validate using `Argon2id` to generate our `DK`, the client will then generate our randomised `REK` and `MK` to be wrapped and salted using the `DK`  tying to the `MK`.

For authentication, only the derivation salt will be transported before using `Argon2id` again to recreate the `DK`, this authetication will then allow for unlocking the other functionality of the app, i.e., using our derived key to unwrap the `REK` for metadata information. 

The client will generate a random `FK` for each uploaded file to be used with `XChaCha20-Poly1305` for the primary object storage and the `FK` (wrapped using the `REK`) for the metadata encryption before uploading back to `MinIO`

# Threat Modeling 

**A01 Broken Access Control**: Given the chosen project modeling, AC will only be a consideration for integrity and owner authentication checks. This does however mean that even though files cannot be actually decrypted due to simple misconfiguration, there is a threat of ownership and metadata can be damaged.

**A02 Security Misconfiguration**: Security misconfiguration will likely both be the most widely problematic and easy to solve threat as the compartmentalised nature of the app and the transport needs to be double checked to be in line with best security practices. 

**A03 Software Supply Chain Failures**: The use of FastAPi and libsodium provide a relatively secure protection against supply chain attacks as these libraries are updated regularly, which shifts my focus to making sure the development enviroment is up to date and configured correctly. 

**A04 Cryptographic Failures**: `XChaCha20-Poly1305` and `Argon2id` are the chosen and relatively sound solutions to cryptographic failures, as I would not like to depend on my own singular mathematical ability to make sure encryption is handled correctly. 

**A05 Injection** As a web based application the vault will of course potentially be vulnerable to XSS and injection attacks, but simple checks for validating all input and security policy headers are already a long standing and well established solution to injection attacks.

**A06 Insecure Design**: The weakest link in the development chain will of course be my own incompetence, in terms of design decisions and policy, this initial design documentation and planning is the most important step in mitigating this potential, as well as following least privilege and zeo trust principles. 

**A07 Authentication Failure**: This ties into the last model of design choices, strong password requirements and enviroment configurations for the cryptographic tools I utilise are an absolute must in addition to session regeneration to prevent authenication failures to the best of the (developers) ability.

**A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures**: This is strongly related to `A03` and the trustworthyness of the libraries and tools used in addition to regular security audits, special care was taken while choosing these dependencies to prevent simple mathemetical incompentence on the part of the sole developer (me) to lead to disaster.

**A09 Security Logging and Alerting Failures**: As established this project will be built entirely upon least privilege and zero trust principles, this including regular and thorough auditing and analysis of all sensitive information.

# Plan 
Currently, the groundwork has been laid and the tech stack and dependencies have been carefuly chosen, the next step will be implenenting the initial `DockerCompose` enviroment and setting up a barebones starting slate to build upon, starting with implementing authentication before moving onto encryption and management in addition to logging for the backend. 

# Build 

There is currently no project so there are no build instructions, this is just the groundwork document.
